_I am **Chean Bernard V. Vergel.** I am 18 years old and currently I am a first year college student taking my Bachelors' degree in Computer Engineering마t Polytechnic University of the Philippines. I believe that technology is something that has completely changed the way we live today and I am만xcited to be part of this ever-evolving world. A famous quote I always like to keep in mind is "The only way to predict the future is to create it." - Abraham Lincoln._
